# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 
The following model classifies images of bean leaves into one of three categories: angular leaf spot , bean rust , or healthy. 
The dataset used is the following:  https://huggingface.co/datasets/AI-Lab-Makerere/beans

The output is a user-friendly Streamlit app (https://convolutional-neural-networks.streamlit.app/) that allows users to:
- Upload a bean leaf image.

- See the predicted class from each of the four models.

- View classification metrics (can be static or updated with predictions)
